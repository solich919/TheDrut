# The Drut
The Drut is a small project, in which I replicate the PCB design of "The Wire (SE-SE)" project from pictures:

The design was reproduced with manual assembly in mind (vias in pads), and I fit it on 2 layer PCB. It is a simple design for sure, but still a good learning experience.
The assembled amp works and sounds really good, but I have no way of measuring it's performance.
